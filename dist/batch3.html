Before this project, users could only individually delete or export geofences.</p></div></div><div class="row spacer"><div class="col col-12"><h3>My Role</h3><p>For this project, I lead brainstorming sessions, created user flows with the project manager, created wireframes, prototypes and final designs.</p></div></div><div class="row spacer"><div class="col col-12"><h3>Why?</h3><p>Unless the client was a developer, the only way for them to delete or export was individually. This caused frustration when users wanted to delete more than one geofence at a time.</p></div></div><div class="row spacer"><div class="col col-12"><h3>Research</h3><p>A previous version of the dashboard had a batch delete and export option that was then removed during another round of design. I evaluated the previous design, spoke to the designer who chose to remove it, and did external research as well.</p></div></div></div><div class="col col-12"><div class="row spacer imageDiv"><div class="col col-12 col-md-6 p-0"><img src="images/batch/batch-full@2x.jpg" class="f-img"><p class="caption">user-flow exploration</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-6 p-0"><img src="images/batch/old-version-1@2x.jpg" class="f-img pl-md-2 pb-2"> <img src="images/batch/old-version-2@2x.jpg" class="f-img pl-md-2"><p class="caption">previous designs of the dashboard</p></div></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-7 offset-md-5"><div class="row spacer"><div class="col col-12"><h3>Design Iterations</h3><p>For a seemingly simple change, this project went through a lot of iterations. The previous design that had the proper functionality seemed a bit disjointed, with the action buttons being quite far away from the objects that were being acted upon. My solution was a "drawer" that would pop open when the user checked off a geofence. This seemed to work well but in presenting it to the project manager, I realized I had missed a key component. The main ask for this project was the ability to mass-export or delete, with a focus on being able to delete or export <em>all</em> of the geofences. This solution made the user go through too many actions to delete all geofences. First the user had to check off the top box, then "select all" and then delete all. This works well if the user usually deletes one and may want to delete 2 or 3, but if the main point was to allow a fast way to delete/export all geofences, then this design missed the mark.</p></div></div></div><div class="col col-12"><div class="row spacer imageDiv"><div class="col col-12 col-md-6"><img src="images/batch/selectall@2x.jpg" class="f-img"><p class="caption">final un-selected state</p></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-6 pl-md-2"><img src="images/batch/selectone@2x.jpg" class="f-img"><p class="caption">final selected state</p></div></div></div><div class="col col-12 col-md-7 offset-md-5"><div class="row spacer"><div class="col"><p>I took a step back and looked at the project from a different lens and thought about how I could make delete all and export all more accessible. A drop-down menu was mentioned as a solution but seemed to be a bandaid rather than something well thought out. After careful consideration, I decided to make the first action available be "export all (xnumber)" and "delete all (xnumber)". After the user ticked off a checkbox, this would change to "export (xnumber)" and "delete (xnumber)". This change allowed for the main action to be easily taken without putting the user through a multi-step process.</p></div></div><div class="row spacer"><div class="col col-12"><h3>Next Steps & Key Learnings</h3><p>This project is currently in its dev handoff stage. Once implemented, we will solicit feedback from users, especially those who asked for this change. The biggest learning from this project was the importance of keeping the users' needs front and center.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="spacer"></div><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-end"><div><a href="queerly-health4.html"><h2>Next</h2></a></div><div><svg width="49" height="16" viewBox="0 0 49 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M1.84497 7.13953C1.29269 7.13953 0.844971 7.58724 0.844971 8.13953C0.844971 8.69181 1.29269 9.13953 1.84497 9.13953L1.84497 7.13953ZM48.5521 8.84663C48.9426 8.4561 48.9426 7.82294 48.5521 7.43242L42.1881 1.06846C41.7976 0.677931 41.1644 0.677931 40.7739 1.06846C40.3834 1.45898 40.3834 2.09214 40.7739 2.48267L46.4308 8.13952L40.7739 13.7964C40.3834 14.1869 40.3834 14.8201 40.7739 15.2106C41.1644 15.6011 41.7976 15.6011 42.1881 15.2106L48.5521 8.84663ZM1.84497 9.13953L47.845 9.13952L47.845 7.13952L1.84497 7.13953L1.84497 9.13953Z" fill="black"/></svg></div></div><div class="spacer"></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="custom-container d-flex align-items-center padding"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciamariemaccara/"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in pr-3"></i></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alimariemac/"><i class="fab fa-instagram pr-3"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/Alimariemac"><i class="fab fa-github-alt pr-3"></i></a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/Alimariemac"><i class="fab fa-dribbble"></i></a></div><script src="js/main.js"></script><script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/9488e2af14.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></div></body></html>
