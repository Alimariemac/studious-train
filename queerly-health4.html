                <p>
                    Queerly Health is a start-up focusing on connecting the LGBTQ community with trained health and wellness providers. I was asked to help implement their
                    refreshed brand into their website as well as improve the functionality of the website. The final site implemented a more user-friendly map and a precise and 
                    clear call-to-action and can be seen live <a href="https://queerly-health.netlify.com/">here.</a>

                    Queerly Health had a marketing website already, but they had problems getting people to sign up for the newsletter and problems with
                    a confusing site structure. The team wanted to streamline their site as well as implement the brand update that I had helped them create.

                    We conducted a wide range of competitive research ranging from medical apps to booking apps. We narrowed our focus down to a few high-performing 
                    competitors including: Zocdoc, Maven, Tia and One Medical. We also created personas based on our two
                    main customer groups; someone looking for a provider, and the provider themselves.

                    Design Iterations
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After going through the existing website, personas and user-flows, I started sketching out ideas on paper to explore the easiest way to present information
                    to the user. One of the main functionality changes was making newsletter sign-up easier.
                    Previously, if a user clicked "sign-up for newletter" they would be punted to a new page that had a form with many inputs including 
                    pronouns, age etc. The new design allowed for the least amount of friction, the user can just enter their email and sign-up. 
                    
                    After presenting to the stakeholders and choosing a direction, I created low-fidelity wireframes of each page and went through them with everyone. During high-fidelity 
                    work, I created components to be used across the platform.

                        The new website was created with the intention of growth. We planned that the landing page would eventually evolve from a marketing page to a functional 
                        search page that would move the user through the sign-up and search flow. Therefore, I created a lot of the design as modules that could be moved around, 
                        added and subtracted.   

                        The resulting website provided a simpler user flow and a clearer call-to action.

                    Next Steps & Key Learnings
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are still in the implementation phase of this project, so next steps are to publish the website and implement continuous user research. 
                    Looking back, this project should have potentially had more time allocated to the design process. This was a quickly implemented project based on time 
                    constraints. I would have also liked to do more user research and spoken to more potential users. This will hopefully be an iterative project and we will continue 
                    to update based on the data we get from google analytics and mailchimp.
